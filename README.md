# messagebird-async

MessageBird is a service for sending SMS at its core https://www.messagebird.com/

## Features

Currently the planned features only include to send SMS and query SMS stati.

There are no immediate plans to support the Voice or Conversation API, if you feel like doing the work, I am happy to review PRs and integrate.

## RoadMap

 - [ ] serde impl for all relevant datatypes incl tests
 - [ ] future for SMS sending and retrieval based on [hyper.rs](https://hyper.rs)
 - [ ] useful examples using [tokio](https://tokio.rs) as executor

## License

MIT or Apache-2.0

If neither of those works for you, feel free to request so via a github issue.
