# messagebird-async

MessageBird is a service for sending SMS at its core https://www.messagebird.com/

## Example

For a full example checkout `src/basic.rs` which will be inlined once the API becomes sufficiently stable.

## Features

Currently the planned features only include to send SMS and query SMS stati.


## RoadMap

 - [x] serde impl for all relevant datatypes
 - [x] roundtrip decode encode tests
 - [x] use [`crate eserde_plain`](https://docs.rs/serde_plain/0.3.0/serde_plain/) for `trait ToString` and `trait FromStr` for objects which are used in filters
 - [ ] future for SMS sending and retrieval based on [hyper.rs](https://hyper.rs)
 - [ ] send SMS example
 - [ ] future for querying SMS
 - [ ] useful examples using [tokio](https://tokio.rs) as executor
 - [ ] future for callback on SMS reception
